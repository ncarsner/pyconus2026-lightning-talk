# Skills Reference Index

This directory contains **agent reference documents** — pattern libraries, configuration
recipes, and code cookbooks. They are read on demand when an agent needs to know
*how* to implement something. They are not invokable commands.

> **Distinction from Claude Code skills:**
> Invokable slash commands live in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
> Files in this directory are reference material — loaded by agents, not invoked by users.

## Invokable Claude Code Skills

These live in `.claude/skills/` and are called via `/skill-name`:

### Idea-to-implementation pipeline

Run these in order to take a raw idea through to automated implementation:

```
/ideate → /grill-me → /prd → /prd-to-issues → /ralph
```

| Step | Skill | Invocation | What it does |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | ideate | `/ideate [idea]` | Surface risks, edge cases, and gaps before investing further |
| 2 | grill-me | `/grill-me [topic]` | Interview relentlessly until reaching shared design understanding |
| 3 | prd | `/prd [project-name]` | Synthesize conversation into a PRD + task JSON in `plans/` |
| 4 | prd-to-issues | `/prd-to-issues [prd-path]` | Convert PRD to GitHub issues (preview before create) |
| 5 | ralph | `/ralph --prd plans/<project>-prd.json` | Invoke ralph.sh PRD loop to work through tasks; also accepts issue numbers or `--all` |

### Utility skills

| Skill | Invocation | What it does |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| orient | `/orient [task]` | Bootstrap context: reads CLAUDE.md, RULES.md, subagent registry, skills index, and surveys repo structure |
| format | `/format [path]` | `ruff format` + `ruff check --fix` |
| test | `/test [flags]` | `pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=100` |
| project-review | `/project-review [perspective]` | Structured multi-lens project audit |
| stress-test | `/stress-test [topic]` | Stress-test a design, code, or proposal with hard questions |
| write-a-skill | `/write-a-skill [name]` | Scaffold a new slash command skill with correct frontmatter and repo conventions |
| caveman | `/caveman` | Ultra-compressed responses (~75% fewer tokens) |
