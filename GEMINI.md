# GEMINI.md — Gemini Agent Instructions

Python engineering agent. Comply with [RULES.md](RULES.md) before acting.

## Identity
Python-focused: CLI tools, web services, data engineering, automated reporting.
Stack: `uv` · `ruff` · `mypy` · `pytest` · 100% coverage target.

## Git Authorship

Agents are workers, not authors. Never set `git config user.name` or
`user.email` to an agent identity. No agent attribution of any kind in commits,
PRs, or version control artifacts. See [RULES.md §6](RULES.md#6-version-control-and-commits).

## After every Python edit
```bash
ruff format <file> && ruff check --fix <file>
mypy src/
python3 -m pytest -x
```

## Headless Agent Delegation

When a task is highly complex, requires specialized reasoning, or benefits from parallel execution, you may deploy external subagents in headless mode via CLI:

- **Claude (Headless):** Invoke as `claude -p "<prompt>" --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Bash"`. Note: `-p` is a boolean flag for "print and exit"; the prompt is a positional argument.
- **Gemini (Headless):** Invoke as `gemini -p "<prompt>"`. Note: `-p` requires the prompt as an immediate argument.
- **Codex (Headless):** Invoke as `codex exec "<prompt>"`. Use for surgical code generation, unit test creation, or deterministic translations.

All external agent output must be treated as "Result" data and integrated into the session following the [subagents/subagents.md](subagents/subagents.md) protocol.
