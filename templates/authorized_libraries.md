## Proposal Process

See RULES.md §5 for the full authorization process. Summary:

1. Check this file — if the library is listed, proceed with `uv add <library>`.
2. If not listed, open a PR with:
   - Library name and PyPI link
   - Proposed version constraint
   - Purpose and justification
   - Output of `python3 -m pip_audit` showing no HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities
3. Do not add to `pyproject.toml` until a human approver has explicitly signed off.
4. Once approved, add to this file with approver name and date, then run `uv add <library>`.
