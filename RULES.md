## 1. Package Management

**Rule:** Always use `uv` as the Python package manager. Never use `pip`,
`pip3`, `conda`, `poetry`, or any other package manager.

### Mandatory commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Create virtual environment | `uv venv` |
| Add a runtime dependency | `uv add <package>` |
| Add a dev-only dependency | `uv add --dev <package>` |
| Remove a dependency | `uv remove <package>` |
| Install all dependencies | `uv sync` |
| Regenerate lock file | `uv lock` |
| Install project in editable mode | `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` |

### Prohibited commands

```bash
# NEVER use these:
pip install <package>
pip3 install <package>
conda install <package>
poetry add <package>
```

### Rationale

`uv` provides deterministic installs via `uv.lock`, is significantly faster
than pip, and is the single source of truth for dependency management across
all projects in this repository.

---

## 2. Python Executable

**Rule:** Always invoke Python using `python3`. Never use `python` (which may
resolve to Python 2 on some systems) or a bare `py` alias.

### Correct usage

```bash
python3 -m pytest              # run tests
python3 -m <package_name>      # run package as module
python3 src/<entry>.py         # run script directly
python3 --version              # verify interpreter version
```

### Prohibited usage

```bash
# NEVER use these:
python script.py
py script.py
```

### Rationale

Using `python3` ensures the correct interpreter is always invoked, regardless
of system-level alias configuration. This prevents silent failures caused by
Python 2 being picked up from `$PATH`.

---

## 3. Code Quality — Docstrings, Type Hints, and Comments

**Rule:** Every public module, class, function, and method MUST include a
docstring, type hints on all parameters and return values, and inline comments
where the logic is non-obvious.

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all public symbols:

```python
def parse_invoice(raw: str, currency: str = "USD") -> dict[str, float]:
    """Parse a raw invoice string into a structured line-item dict.

    Args:
        raw: The raw invoice text as received from the upstream source.
        currency: ISO 4217 currency code. Defaults to "USD".

    Returns:
        A mapping of line-item description to amount in the given currency.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `raw` is empty or cannot be parsed.
        KeyError: If a required field is missing from the invoice.
    """
```

Rules:
- One-line summary on the first line, followed by a blank line if there are
  additional sections.
- Document every parameter (`Args:`), return value (`Returns:`), and exception
  that can propagate (`Raises:`).
- Private helpers (`_name`) should have at minimum a one-line docstring.

### Type hints

- Annotate every function/method signature, including `self`-less methods and
  standalone functions.
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of modules that reference
  forward-declared types.
- Prefer built-in generics (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`) over `typing.List`
  and `typing.Dict` (Python ≥ 3.9).
- Use `Optional[X]` only for clarity; prefer `X | None` in Python ≥ 3.10.

```python
# Good
def fetch_records(limit: int, offset: int = 0) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
    ...

# Bad — missing annotations
def fetch_records(limit, offset=0):
    ...
```

### Inline comments

- Add a comment above any block of logic that is not immediately obvious from
  reading the code (e.g., algorithmic tricks, regex patterns, bitwise ops).
- Do **not** add comments that merely restate what the code already says.

```python
# Good — explains the "why"
# Retry up to 3 times with exponential back-off to handle transient HTTP 429s.
for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
    ...

# Bad — restates the "what"
# Add 1 to counter
counter += 1
```

### Enforcement

Run the following after every edit:

```bash
ruff format <file_path>        # auto-format
ruff check --fix <file_path>   # auto-fix lint issues
mypy src/                      # verify type correctness
```

## 4. Documentation — Keeping README Current

**Rule:** Whenever a code change affects public-facing behavior, adds or removes
a feature, changes a configuration option, or modifies the project's setup
steps, the `README.md` MUST be updated in the same commit or PR.

### What always requires a README update

- Adding or removing a CLI command, API endpoint, or major feature
- Changing setup, installation, or configuration instructions
- Modifying required environment variables or secrets
- Adding or removing a supported Python version
- Changing the project's public interface (imports, function signatures)

### What does NOT require a README update

- Pure refactors with no behavioral change
- Internal test additions or updates
- Dependency version bumps with no user-visible impact
- Fixing a bug whose behavior was never documented

### Process

1. Make your code change.
2. Ask: *"Does this change affect anything a user or operator of this project
   needs to know?"*
3. If yes, update the relevant section(s) of `README.md` before opening a PR.
4. If a new feature deserves its own section, add it under a descriptive heading.

---

## 5. Third-Party Library Authorization

**Rule:** Before adding any third-party library to a project, verify it is
listed in the project's **authorized library file**. If it is not listed,
**stop and request human approval** before proceeding.

### Authorized library file

The authorized library file is located at:

```
<project-root>/authorized_libraries.md   # preferred location
```

If no such file exists in the project, create one using the template below and
request human sign-off before populating it.

### Authorized libraries template

```markdown
# Authorized Third-Party Libraries

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Approved by: <name or team>

| Library | Version constraint | Purpose | Approved by | Date |
|---------|--------------------|---------|-------------|------|
| requests | >=2.31,<3 | HTTP client | <name> | YYYY-MM-DD |
| pydantic | >=2.0,<3 | Data validation | <name> | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

### Process for adding a new library

1. Check `authorized_libraries.md` — if the library is already listed,
   proceed with `uv add <library>`.
2. If the library is **not** listed, create a proposal comment in the PR or
   issue that includes:
   - Library name and link to PyPI
   - Proposed version constraint
   - Purpose and justification
   - Any known security advisories (check via `pip-audit` or GitHub Advisory DB)
3. **Do not add the library to `pyproject.toml` until a human approver has
   explicitly approved the proposal.**
4. Once approved, add the library to `authorized_libraries.md` with the
   approver's name and date, then run `uv add <library>`.

### Security check (mandatory for new libraries)

Before requesting approval, run a vulnerability scan:

```bash
uv add --dev pip-audit
python3 -m pip_audit --requirement <(uv pip compile pyproject.toml)
```

Any HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities must be resolved or explicitly accepted
before the library may be added.

---

## 6. Version Control and Commits

**Rule:** Every commit must be atomic, descriptive, and traceable to a task or
issue.

### Commit message format

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short imperative description>

[optional body]

[optional footer: BREAKING CHANGE, Closes #123, etc.]
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`,
`perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`.

### Rules

- Never bundle unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Never commit directly to `main` or `master` — always use a feature branch.
- Every PR must reference an issue (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- Merge commits are preferred over squash when the history is meaningful.

### Authorship

**Agents are workers, not authors.** The git author identity must always reflect
the human who owns the work. Agents must never run `git config user.name` or
`git config user.email` to set an agent identity. No agent attribution of any
kind — including `Co-Authored-By:` trailers — may appear in commits, PRs, or
any version control artifact.

---

## 7. Testing and Coverage

**Rule:** All new code MUST be accompanied by tests. The minimum acceptable
coverage is **100%** for new modules; legacy modules must not decrease in
coverage.

### Required practices

- Test files named `test_<module>.py` in the `tests/` directory.
- Test functions named `test_<behavior_under_test>`.
- Use `pytest.fixture` for shared state; use `pytest.mark.parametrize` for
  data-driven cases.
- Mock all external I/O (network, filesystem, database) with `unittest.mock`
  or `pytest-mock`.
- Run the full suite before every PR:

```bash
python3 -m pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=100
```

### Prohibited practices

- Do NOT delete or comment out tests to make a build pass.
- Do NOT use `# noqa` or `# type: ignore` to suppress errors without a
  documented reason in the same line or adjacent comment.

---

## 8. Security and Secrets

**Rule:** No secret, credential, API key, token, or password may ever appear in
source code or be committed to the repository.

### Mandatory practices

- Load all secrets via environment variables using `python-dotenv` or
  `os.environ`.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately when creating a new project.
- Add `.env-template` that mimics `.env` with expected keys but includes no values. 
- Use `parameterized queries` for all database interactions — never use string
  concatenation to build SQL.
- Validate and sanitize **all** external input before it reaches business logic.
- Run `git-secrets` or `trufflehog` as a pre-commit hook if available.

### If a secret is accidentally committed

1. Immediately rotate/revoke the exposed credential.
2. Use `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo Cleaner` to scrub the history.
3. Force-push the cleaned history and notify affected parties.

---

## 9. Error Handling

**Rule:** Never use bare `except:` clauses. Always catch specific exceptions and
handle or re-raise them with context.

```python
# Good
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except ValueError as exc:
    logger.error("Invalid value in risky_operation: %s", exc)
    raise

# Bad
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:          # catches KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit, etc.
    pass
```

### Additional rules

- Use custom exception classes (subclasses of `Exception`) for domain-specific
  errors.
- Always log the exception before re-raising or swallowing it.
- Never silently swallow exceptions unless there is an explicit and documented
  reason.
- Propagate errors upward to a defined error boundary; do not let errors leak
  silently across layers.

---

## 10. Logging and Observability

**Rule:** Use the standard `logging` module (or `structlog` for services) for
all diagnostic output. Never use `print()` in library or service code.

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Good
logger.info("Processing %d records", len(records))
logger.warning("Rate limit approaching: %d remaining", remaining)
logger.error("Failed to connect to %s: %s", host, exc)

# Bad
print(f"Processing {len(records)} records")
```

### Log level guidelines

| Level | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `DEBUG` | Detailed trace information for development |
| `INFO` | Normal operational events (start, stop, milestone) |
| `WARNING` | Something unexpected that is recoverable |
| `ERROR` | A failure that prevented an operation from completing |
| `CRITICAL` | A failure that requires immediate human attention |

---

## 11. Architecture Boundaries

**Rule:** All code in this repository must respect the following layer boundaries.
Never skip a layer or bypass a boundary.

```
External Input (user, file, API) -> Validation -> Logic -> I/O -> Output
```

1. Business logic must not import from the I/O layer directly.
2. I/O layer functions must not contain business logic.
3. Validation must happen before business logic runs.
4. Secrets must never appear in source code — load from environment.

---

## 12. Local-Only Agent Directory

**Rule:** When copying this repository's agentic materials into another project,
place them in an `AGENTS/` directory and immediately add `AGENTS/` to that
project's `.gitignore`. The `AGENTS/` directory must remain untracked and must
never be committed to another repository. This repository is the master source.
