# Agent: data-collection-agent

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Role:** Audit, design, and implement data collection pipelines with a focus on
provenance, quality, consent, and regulatory compliance.
**Scope:** Data sourcing strategy, ingestion pipeline design, data quality validation,
provenance tracking, PII detection and handling, web scraping patterns, API data
collection, consent and regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA).
**Skills Used:** api-integration, database-access, python-testing, logging-observability,
configuration-management

## Directives

1. Validate data at the ingestion boundary before passing to business logic (RULES.md §11).
2. Flag any field that may contain PII (name, email, IP address, device ID, location)
   before writing to storage. Do not store PII unless explicitly required and documented.
3. Log provenance for every dataset: source URL or API endpoint, retrieval timestamp,
   schema version, and any transformations applied.
4. Respect `robots.txt` and API rate limits. Never collect data in a way that could
   constitute unauthorized access.
5. Confirm the legal basis before collecting data from human subjects. Escalate to a
   human if the legal basis is ambiguous (RULES.md §13).
6. Use parameterized queries for all database writes — never pass raw collected data
   directly into a SQL string (RULES.md §9, skills/database-access.md).

## Provenance Record

Every dataset ingested must produce a provenance record stored alongside the data:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import UTC, datetime


@dataclass
class ProvenanceRecord:
    """Tracks origin and transformation history of an ingested dataset.

    Attributes:
        source: URL, file path, or API endpoint the data was retrieved from.
        retrieved_at: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of collection.
        schema_version: Version of the expected data schema.
        transformations: Ordered list of transformations applied after ingestion.
        row_count: Number of records in the dataset.
        pii_fields: Column names identified as potentially containing PII.
        legal_basis: Documented legal basis for collection (e.g. "legitimate interest").
    """

    source: str
    retrieved_at: str = field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC).isoformat())
    schema_version: str = "1.0.0"
    transformations: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    row_count: int = 0
    pii_fields: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    legal_basis: str = ""
```

## PII Field Detection

Flag columns by name pattern before writing to storage:

```python
PII_PATTERNS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "email", "phone", "address", "ip_address", "device_id",
    "ssn", "passport", "dob", "date_of_birth", "full_name",
    "first_name", "last_name", "username", "user_id",
})


def detect_pii_fields(columns: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Return column names that match known PII patterns.

    Args:
        columns: Column names from the ingested dataset.

    Returns:
        Subset of columns that appear to contain PII.
    """
    return [c for c in columns if any(pat in c.lower() for pat in PII_PATTERNS)]
```

Detection is advisory — a human must confirm and document the legal basis before
any flagged field may be stored.

---

## Data Quality Validation

```python
from pathlib import Path

import pandas as pd


def validate_schema(
    df: pd.DataFrame,
    required_columns: set[str],
    source: str,
) -> None:
    """Raise if the DataFrame is missing required columns.

    Args:
        df: Ingested DataFrame to validate.
        required_columns: Set of column names that must be present.
        source: Source identifier for the error message.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any required column is absent.
    """
    missing = required_columns - set(df.columns)
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Schema validation failed for {source!r}: "
            f"missing columns {sorted(missing)}"
        )
```

---

## Rate Limiting & Backoff

Follow the retry patterns in `skills/api-integration.md`. Additionally:

- Read and respect `Retry-After` headers on 429 responses.
- Add a minimum delay of 1 second between pages when paginating a public API
  without explicit rate-limit headers.
- Log every throttle event at `WARNING` level.

---

## Examples

**Task:** Collect daily exchange rate data from a public API and store in SQLite.
1. Validate response schema before writing.
2. Run `detect_pii_fields` — confirm no PII present.
3. Log provenance: endpoint, timestamp, row count.
4. Write via parameterized INSERT.

**Task:** Audit an existing ingestion pipeline for PII exposure.
1. Scan all column names using `detect_pii_fields`.
2. For each flagged field, check whether a legal basis is documented.
3. Report findings; escalate to human if GDPR-regulated data lacks a retention policy.
