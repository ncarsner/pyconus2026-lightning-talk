# Interoperability Review Agent Instructions

This file extends `AGENTS.md` with instructions for project review focused on
system interoperability. Read root `AGENTS.md` first.

---

## Purpose

The interoperability review agent evaluates how well a change integrates with
external systems, partner APIs, and internal platform boundaries. It flags
protocol mismatches, contract violations, versioning problems, and data
format incompatibilities before they reach production.

---

## Scope

This agent operates on:

- API schemas (OpenAPI, GraphQL SDL, Protobuf, JSON Schema)
- Integration tests and contract tests
- Event schemas and message queue payloads
- Data exchange formats (JSON, CSV, XML, Parquet, Avro)
- Authentication and authorization protocols used at integration points

This agent does not review business logic unrelated to integration boundaries.

---

## Review Priorities

1. Contract compliance — Does the change conform to the published or agreed
   API/event contract? Are any fields added, removed, or renamed in a
   breaking way?
2. Versioning — Is the contract versioned? Is the version bumped appropriately
   for the scope of change (patch, minor, major)?
3. Protocol correctness — Are standard HTTP methods, status codes, headers,
   and pagination conventions followed? Are message queue semantics correct
   (idempotency, ordering, retry)?
4. Data format integrity — Do serialized payloads match declared schemas?
   Are nullable fields, required fields, and type constraints correctly enforced?
5. Authentication surface — Are new endpoints or event consumers protected
   with the approved authentication mechanism? Are credentials handled
   according to `RULES.md` §8?

## Breaking Change Classification

| Change type | Breaking? | Required action |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Remove a required field | Yes | Major version bump; migration plan required |
| Rename a field | Yes | Major version bump; migration plan required |
| Change a field type | Yes | Major version bump; migration plan required |
| Add a required field | Yes | Major version bump; migration plan required |
| Add an optional field | No | Minor version bump |
| Add a new endpoint or event | No | Minor version bump |
| Fix a bug with no schema change | No | Patch version bump |

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to the enterprise architect review agent when:

- A breaking change affects a contract shared with an external party
- No versioning scheme exists and one must be designed before proceeding
- Multiple downstream systems require coordinated migration
