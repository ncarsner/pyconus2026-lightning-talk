Orient yourself to this repository before acting. Complete all four steps in order.

## Step 1 — Core identity and rules

Read both files in full:

- `CLAUDE.md` — agent identity, toolchain, post-edit checklist, and on-demand resource table
- `RULES.md` — mandatory compliance rules (all 12 enforced sections + placeholders)

Key rules to internalize:
- Package manager: `uv` only (RULES.md §1)
- Python executable: `python3` only (RULES.md §2)
- Docstrings + type hints required on all public symbols (RULES.md §3)
- No secrets in source; load via env vars (RULES.md §8)
- No agent attribution in commits or PRs (RULES.md §6)
- 100% test coverage target for new modules (RULES.md §7)

## Step 2 — Delegation and skills registry

Read both index files:

- `subagents/subagents.md` — agent identity protocol, delegation rules, registered agents
- `skills/skills.md` — available reference files and invokable slash commands

## Step 3 — Repo structure survey

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \
  -not -path './.git/*' \
  -not -path './.venv/*' \
  -not -path './node_modules/*' \
  -not -path './__pycache__/*' \
  | sort
```

Also run:

```bash
ls -1 subagents/ && ls -1 skills/
```

## Step 4 — Orientation summary

Report a concise summary covering:
1. Agent identity (from CLAUDE.md §Identity)
2. Which subagents are registered and which to delegate to for the current task
3. Repo layout — top-level directories and their purpose
4. Any RULES.md constraints directly relevant to the current task (if one was provided via $ARGUMENTS)

If $ARGUMENTS is non-empty, treat it as the incoming task description and note which
registered subagent(s) and skills are relevant before proceeding.
