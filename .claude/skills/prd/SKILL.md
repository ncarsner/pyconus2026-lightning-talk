Synthesize the current conversation into a Product Requirements Document for $ARGUMENTS (or the project discussed if no argument is given).

## PRD structure

Produce a document with these sections in order:

1. **Title** — one line, imperative
2. **Overview** — two sentences: what this is and why it exists
3. **Goals** — three to five measurable outcomes
4. **Non-goals** — explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep
5. **User stories** — `As a [role], I want [action] so that [value]` — one per major workflow
6. **Requirements** — numbered list; each requirement is independently testable
7. **Acceptance criteria** — checkbox list mapped to requirements
8. **Open questions** — unresolved items from the grill-me session

## Output

1. Write the PRD in markdown to `plans/<project-name>-prd.md`.
2. Also write a task list in JSON to `plans/<project-name>-prd.json` following the schema in `plans/prd.json` — one entry per requirement with `task`, `category`, `priority`, `done`, `description`, `files_affected`, `acceptance_criteria`, and `steps` fields.
3. Confirm both files written and ask: "Ready to create GitHub issues? Run `/prd-to-issues plans/<project-name>-prd.md`."

Constraints:
- Do not fabricate decisions not established in the conversation.
- If a section cannot be filled from the conversation, write `TBD — resolve before development starts`.
- Never skip the Open questions section.
