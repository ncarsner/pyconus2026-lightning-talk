Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of $ARGUMENTS (or the current plan if no argument is given) until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one by one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

When shared understanding is reached, summarize:
- The decisions made and their rationale
- Open questions that remain unresolved
- A prompt to the user: "Ready to write the PRD? Run `/prd`."
